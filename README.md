# Kristina-Ahn-Portfolio


## Description


This Portfolio provides future employers with information about myself (Kristina Ahn), projects that I am most proud of, and a few  ways to contact me. 


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To navigate through this webpage click on the buttons below the header. Each button will take you to the appropriate section ( About Me, Projects, and Contact Me). To view projects click on the images in the project section and you should be rerouted to the deployed link. Currently, there is only one project deployed and the rest of the images are placeholders, therefore, some links are not navigationa. 

## Credits

I would like to thank my wonderful classmates, Brian (Teacher), and Shawn (TA), for helping me complete this project.
